    Extends cs_dt_crack to support newer types

    This add a new cs_dt_crack_v2 ABI function (cs_dt_crack API is redirected
    to it using a preprocessor macro). This to make the extension of
    CS_DATEREC more safe (version of 1.0 could call cs_dt_crack with
    CS_BIGDATETIME_TYPE/CS_BIGTIME_TYPE without having these fields written
    which would possible cause memory corruption on version compiled with
    these fields missing).
    This make sqsh compile and work with newer date/time types.

    Avoid to strip spaces from procedure text.

    NTBSTRINGBIND strip spaces at the end.
    Using STRINGBIND with 0 size cause string to be just NUL terminated.
    The 0 would lead to a possible overflow however we check the column
    len before doing the bind to avoid such possibility.

    Original patch from Nem W Schlecht.

    do not compile as bundle under Mac OS X is --with-odbc-nodm is specified

    In this case the driver will be used as a dynamic library (not loaded
    dynamically) so compile as such.
    In case a DM is used unit tests/application will link to the DM which
    will load the driver (requiring to be a module on old Mac OS X versions).
